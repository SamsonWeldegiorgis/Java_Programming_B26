    We should be goo in String manupulation .
    String : not primitive, but class and object type, sequence of chars.
             it is a member of java.lang package - no need to import
             * 2 wasys to create string :
                ` 1. String literal(mostly used ) = String str= "Apples";. created in string pool in heap memory
                ` 2. New keyword .....String str2 = new String ("Apple"):...created in heap directly

                * both are same in terms of usage, but only differs for memory allocation.

    String objects are immutable which means unmodifieble/unchangeable.

    String a= "Apple";  a new object is created in string pool, in heap
    a= "Apple";  // a new obj is created in str pool in heap, not modified from the former version.
